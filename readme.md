ZACBank is a banking service in America that provides personal banking, business and corporate banking, investment and wealth management, digital and online banking, foreign exchange and international banking, insurance and risk management and specialized services.

Recently the customers of the ZACbank were unable to access online services that are provided by ZACBank. As result, a significant amount of revenue was lost. The Chief Information Security Office of ZACBank requested CyberSafe, an external security firm to conduct a security audit to find the root cause of the problem.

CyberSafe accepted the request of ZACBank and conducted the audit. Several vulnerabilities were identified by the network security assessment report and security protocols were placed by CyberSafe Engineers to mitigate denial of service attacks and other security threats in the future.
